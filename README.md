This project was developed to in an attempt to pass the following front-end development application for Forbes: 
The Exercise
Using any image API of your choice, or API that returns content with images:
● Retrieve a list of at least 50 images and display them as thumbnails on a page
● Paginate thumbnails by 10 thumbnails per page
● When clicking on an image it should display in a modal.
● All images should be about a specific theme or based on a specific word
Technical Constraints
● The Application should be built with html/js/css
● You may use pre-processors for css (but no frameworks, such as bootstrap)
● You may use whatever build tools you want
● The application should work and run when executing
○ `npm i && npm start` from its root directory
● Please code in vanilla JS (no frameworks, or libraries)
● Take responsive design into consideration
● Your application only needs to work in Chrome
● If applicable: Include instructions for running your unit tests

Of all the requirements in this project I was able to accomplish all except making the API function correctly. I was able to retrieve the data however I ran into issues with Promises when trying to get multiple calls to work and push the data into one array. If given the time I would certainly be able to fix this.
